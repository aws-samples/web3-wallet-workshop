There are number of ways to check the balance of Ethereum or Bitcoin. The easiest way is to use an existing web service. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is commonly used to look up Ethereum, and [Blockchain explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) for Bitcoin. You can also enjoy these kind of services with AWS AMB Query! 


In this session, we are working with Ethereum/Bitcoin Balance. You can see [Etherscan example](https://etherscan.io/address/0x188B264AA1456B869C3a92eeeD32117EbB835f47) and [Blockchain explorer example](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1MZX6ExdDzWefGbD6Dc4bShdBRoNA3ijLF) below. We are making this kind of service from now.
